Pairwise sequence alignment is a useful tool in many fields of biology. For example, the similarity between sequences can be used in evolutionary analysis to find out what organisms share a common ancestor. Alternatively, the similarity between amino acid sequences can be used to predict the structure and functions of protein domains. Another use of pairwise sequence analysis is in genome sequencing assembly, where matches are used to find overlaps in the shorter pieces of DNA sequenced. (Source:Genome Assembly Page)

Now the question we will try to answer in the post:

**How similar are two sequences?**
