        Let me begin by providing a simple overview of my professional endeavors. As a Senior Machine Learning Researcher and Lead Data Scientist, I possess a diverse skill set that encompasses both technical and managerial expertise. Currently, I am employed by a core product-based company, where I actively contribute to and manage several crucial ML projects that are directly linked with company revenue. These projects primarily revolve around Optimization Problems, Gen AI, Explainable AI, Deep Learning, Imbalance Classification, and other related areas. Additionally, I have authored the book "Machine Learning Cookbook with Python," published by BPB Publications, and have made significant contributions to the field through publications, patents, and participation in prestigious events such as the CPS Challenge 2020 funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and sponsored by NASA. Furthermore, I have conducted workshops and seminars for various universities, sharing my knowledge and expertise in this research domain, while also contributing to Open Source Software initiatives like a contribution for Google Tensorflow Addons.
